		“All that is gold does not glitter,<br>
		Not all those who wander are lost;<br>
		The old that is strong does not wither,<br>
		Deep roots are not reached by the frost.<br>

		From the ashes a fire shall be woken,<br>
		A light from the shadows shall spring;<br>
		Renewed shall be blade that was broken,<br>
		The crownless again shall be king.”<br>
		—J.R.R. Tolkien, The Fellowship of the Ring
